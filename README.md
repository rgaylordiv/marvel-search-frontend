# Marvel Comic Search

## About The Project

Hello! This is the Marvel Comic Search. This site is meant to be used as a library that can be used to find your favorite hero's and comics they have appeared. By using the Marvel API, I was able to use all of the elements that I have learned from my past projects and combine them with new ideas, such as a functional search bar that connects to a third-party API. As a huge Marvel nerd this has been a passion project and I'm excited to be able to deliver this type of project.

## Techniques

For this project I used React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS (flexbox, grid, animations), Vite.js, and md5.
